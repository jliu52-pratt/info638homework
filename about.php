<p>HK COVID-19 Portal is a prototype website created for Hong Kong health officials to collect self-reported data from Hong Kong residents who may need to enter compulsory quarantine.</p><br>
<p>Residents are asked to sign up and fill in their personal data regarding their contact information, address, medical history, and site of possible COVID-19 exposure. A health official will review the data and contact the resident shortly to arrange transport and accomodation to a quarantine camp if necessary.</p><br> 
<p>Please note all of the patient's data can only be accessed by the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection.</p>
